        <p> <a href="https://www.gcflearnfree.org/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/">Operating Systems </a>are the underlying system software in a computer that controls and processes all of the information 
            that it needs for it to function properly. For example, programs and applications that run on a computer such as Chrome, Microsoft Word, Spotify, etc.
            The Operating system is also in charge of managing all of the hardware, such as cpu's, gpu's, keyboard, mouse, etc. </p>
        <p> When there are multiple programs running, the operating system coordinates all the different programs and 
            tasks that need to be completed so they all run fluidly and simultaneously.</p>

        <p> Most often than not, computers come pre loaded with some sort of operating systems however it is possible to upgrade and even change 
            operating systems. There are many operating systems available, however that most pepular are Windows, Mac OS and Linux.</p>
        
        <p> Every operating system uses a GUI, graphical user interface, to allow the user to effortlessly navigate the computer and utilize the harware.
            GUI's are what set operating systems apart, that and how well they perform. Modern GUI's are easy to use but can become confusing when switching from 
            operating system to operating system since each behaves somewhat differently.</p>
