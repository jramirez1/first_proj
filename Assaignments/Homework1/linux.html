        <a href="https://www.gcflearnfree.org/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/">Linux</a> is an opened sourced operating system that consists of different variations, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, 
        Debian, and many more. Linux, because ot is opened sourced, can be modified and distributed by anyone who wishes so. 
        Linux, although useful and free, is not all that popular with the general consume. Approximately Linux users only account for 2% of 
        of all operating systems. 
    </p>
    <p> Nonetheless, the majority of servers run on linux for the reason that the system is highly customizable. </p>

            This image is the homescreen to one of the most popular distributions of linx, Ubuntu. Ubuntu
            was announced in 2004 and has become the face of linux because of its popularity. 
        </p>
        
        <p> Another great thing about Linux is how secure it is. Since the OS is open sourced, many people work on patches and 
        other security measures. Security updates for linux operating systems are much more frequent than tgose for Mac OS and Windows OS.</p>
