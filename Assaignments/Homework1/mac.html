        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS#Development">Mac OS </a> is an operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. Mac OS is the main system used in Apple’s family of computers. Mac OS is the secon most used operating system , falling behind Microsoft Windows. The first version of Mac OS was introduced in 1984, it is now called “classic” Mac OS. Apple’s first
        desktop OS was released as Mac OS X in 2001. On a side note, Apple began naming all concurrent upgrades of the system after big cats, up until 2013, when it began naming them after landmarks.

        Mac OS is written in C++, Objective-C, and Swift. Mac OS inspired Windows
        to create its own GUI, Windows OS.

        From personal experience, I can conclude that Mac OS is a smoother and faster
        OS than windows, although at times Windows seems stronger and better equipped.
