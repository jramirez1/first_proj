         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows </a> was created in the mid-1980s, and over the years multiple versions have been released. 
         Because the majority of the market share is taken up by PCs with Windows pre-loaded, it has become the most popular and widely used 
         Operating system.

         After Apples relese of MAC OS in 1984, Microsoft release their own, Windows, which soon took over 90% of the market share. 
         Microsoft's release of Windows, was in response to the growing intrest in Graphical User Interfaces, otherwise known as GUIs.

        This is Microsoft's newest version of their OS, Windows 10. Not only is it on PCs but it also runs on tablets, phones, embedded devices, and even a custom version of windows runs on the Xbox. 
        Windows can sometimes be a pain to use, but overall the functionalities it has makes it the best OS, in my opinion, if you want to get some serious work done.
